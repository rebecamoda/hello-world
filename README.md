# hello-world
Hi everyone, i'm Rebeca Moda, a brazilian animal science student that lives in the state of Amazonas and is absolutely what they would call "a true manauara". I am very new to the plataform and coding, but very eager to learn more and more each day. Also, i'm a passionate book lover and a very clumsy gamer in my free time.
